"""Per-request actor + intent context for audit writes.

Two contextvars carry the audit-relevant request state through every awaited
service-layer call without threading them through every signature:

- `actor_var` — the resolved `CurrentActor`, or `None` for unauthenticated /
  pre-auth segments (e.g. `POST /auth/login`).
- `intent_var` — the `IntentContext` carrying `intent_hash` (prefixed source
  per ADR-010 amendment + spike Decision #6) and free-form `intent_metadata`.

The middleware (`AuditContextMiddleware`) sets both at request entry and
resets at exit. `asyncio.TaskGroup` and ordinary `await` propagate
contextvars correctly; FastAPI `BackgroundTasks` inherits them at enqueue
time. Workers (future arq epic) MUST set `actor_var` from the serialised
job context — that contract is documented in ADR-010 §"Actor + intent flow".
